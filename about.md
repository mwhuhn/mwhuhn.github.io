<p class="message">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University under Prof. David Grusky. I also work with Prof. Florencia Torche and the Center for Poverty and Inequality. My interests lie in disability and the intersection between legal systems and inequality. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a Hearing Officer at the Virginia Department of Social Services and received my JD from Washington and Lee University.</p>
