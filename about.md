I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University under Prof. David Grusky. My interests lie in disability and the intersection between legal systems and inequality. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a Hearing Officer at the Virginia Department of Social Services and received my JD from Washington and Lee University.</p>
